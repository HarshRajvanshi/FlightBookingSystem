You will be supplied a Reservation Code and E ticket number as your proof of purchase. With an E-ticket, your name and flight details will be in the airlines computer. An E-ticket is NOT a boarding pass. You will still have to check-in to receive your boarding pass. All tickets purchased online are issued as electronic tickets will be sent to your registered email. If you donâ€™t receive your E-ticket Receipt within 2 hours after purchase, please contact us for supports. PLEASE NOTE: Some airlines regulations require you to present a printed receipt of your E-ticket purchase in order to receive a boarding pass. Please be certain to print your confirmation details page or your confirmation email and bring it with you to the airport.",
